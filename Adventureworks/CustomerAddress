Retrieving Customer Addresses
Customers can have two kinds of address; 
A main office address and a shipping address. The accounts department wants to ensure that the main office address is always used for billing,
and you've been asked to write a query that clearly identifies the different types of address for each customer.
Write a query that retrieves the name of company, AddressLine1, City, StateProvince and Country.
Also create a column named AddressType for value 'Billing Address' for customers where the address type is 'Main Office'.
