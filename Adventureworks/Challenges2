-- Write a query that queries the SalesLT.Address table and retrieves the values for City and StateProvince, removing duplicates 
and sorted in ascending order of city.

SELECT DISTINCT City, StateProvince
FROM SalesLT.Address
ORDER BY City

-- Retrieve the heaviest products
-- Transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products. Retrieve the names of the top ten percent of products by weight.

SELECT TOP(10) percent ProductID, Name, Weight
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY Weight DESC

2)Retrieve product data
-- The Production Manager at Adventure Works would like you to create some reports listing details of the products that you sell.
-- Write a query listing the names, colors, and sizes of the products with a product model ID 1.

SELECT Name, Color, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductModelID = 1

-- Retrieve the product number and name of the products that have a color of black, red, or white and a size of S or M.

SELECT ProductNumber, Name, Color, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE Color IN ('black', 'red', 'white') AND size in ('s', 'm')

-- Retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products whose product number begins BK-

SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice
from SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE ('BK%')

-- Modify your previous query to retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products whose product number begins BK- followed by 
any character other than R, and ends with a - followed by any two numerals.

-- To get a numeral, use [0-9].

SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE ('BK-[^R]%-[0-9][0-9]%')
